# utils

This folder holds general-purpose helper functions.

**Purpose:**

- Functions that don't belong to a specific feature, but are used across multiple parts of the app.

**When to add a file:**

- When you create reusable logic (e.g., validators, token generators, formatters).

**Example:**

- `generateToken.js` → Creates JWT tokens.
- `validateEmail.js` → Validates if a string is a proper email.
